The **didnp** package contains tools for computing average treatment effect parameters in a Difference-in-Differences setup allowing for

* More than two time periods


The main parameters are **group-time average treatment effects**.  These are 

Group-time average treatment effects are 


## Getting Started

The **didnp** package implements the framework put forward in

* 


## Installation

You can install **didnp** from CRAN with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("didnp")
```

or get the latest version from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("OlegBadunenko/didnp")
```

## A short example

The following is a simplified example of the effect of states increasing their minimum wages on county-level teen employment rates which comes from [that](https://elsevier.com/).

A subset of the data is available in the package and can be loaded by
```{r eval=FALSE}
  library(didnp)
  data(qqqqqqqq)
```

The dataset contains 500 observations

* **lemp** This is the log of county-level teen employment.  It is the outcome variable

* **first.treat** 

To estimate group-time average treatment effects, use the **didnpreg** function

```{r eval=FALSE}
tym1 <- didnpreg(
  form1,
  data = dat2,
  subset = mysmpl,
  bwmethod = "opt",
  boot.num = 399,
  TTb = TRUE,
  print.level = 2,
  cores = 32)
```

**didnpreg** returns a class **didnp** object.  This object contains estimates of the average treatment effects and their standard errors.  To see these, we can call the **summary** function

```{r eval=FALSE}
summary(tym1)
```

This provides estimates of 

It is often also convenient to plot the group-time average treatment effects.  This can be done using the **didnpplot** command:

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{R eval=FALSE}
didnpplot(tym1, ylim = c(-.25,.1))
```

The red dots in the plot are
